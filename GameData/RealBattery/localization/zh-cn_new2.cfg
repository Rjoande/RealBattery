        #LOC_RB_descDet_Nuke = This exotic battery stores energy in nuclear isotopes that can be stimulated with a Radiation-Induced Pulse (R.I.P.) to decay on demand. Unlike traditional RTGs, its output can be modulated, offering responsive power without the complexity of a full reactor. <#FF0000>Low but non-zero probability of spontaneous runaway.</color>
